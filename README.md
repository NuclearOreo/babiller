# Learning How to Crate a Programming Language

[![Rust](https://github.com/NuclearOreo/babiller/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/NuclearOreo/babiller/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

The project is mostly for learning purposes. Building myself a language (I'm calling it babiller, babble in French) so I get a better understanding of how a parser would work. Touching on topic of evaluation, function, blocks, binding, expressions etc.

## Basic Commands

- Build Source: `cargo build`
- Run Tests: `cargo test`
- CLI or REPL: `cargo r -q`
